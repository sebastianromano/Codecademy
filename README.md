### *Selection of Codecademy Problems*

Each folder contains my submitted solutions in Java to the various [Codecademy Problems](https://www.codecademy.com).

The aim of this repository is to help other aspiring Codecademics who struggles with a certain problem and need some hints. 
It is recommended to **try your own solutions first**, and, if nothing works, take a look at my attempts!
